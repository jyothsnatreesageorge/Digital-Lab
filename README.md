This repository contains all the programs related to **S4 course of Digital Electronics Lab(KTU 2019 scheme).**  
All these programs are done in **verilog** language and all the implemented code contains both the main verilog code and the test bench as the simulation source.  
The questions for the lab exercises are given below:  

1.Implement a binary adder.  
2.Implement a Binary to Gray code converter.  
3.Implement a verilog code that simplifies the sum of minterms Σ(2,4,5,8,11,15)  
4.Implement a verilog code that simplifies the sum of minterms Σ(0,1,2,3,5)  
5.Implemet D flipflop.  
6.Implement a decade counter.  
7.Implement Demultiplexer.  
8.Implement Full Adder.  
9.Implement Full Subtractor.  
10.Implement Half Adder.  
11.Implement JK flipflop.  
12.Implement Johnson Counter.  
13.Implement Multiplexer.  
14.Implement realisation of basic logic gates using verilog.  
15.Implement Ring Counter.  
16.Implement SR flipflop.  
17.Implement Sequence Counter that counts the sequence 8,12,13,15,8....  
18.Implement T flipflop.
